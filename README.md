ArduinoIDE-GCC-4.6.2
====================

Arduino IDE for the Teensy 3.0 with C++11 support (gcc 4.6.2)

The sole pupose of this repository is to host my fork of the Arduino IDE  for the Teensy 3.0.
Why? I wanted C++11 support on the Teensy 3.0 (using an ARM Cortex M4 with hard fp)  and i bundled it with a static 
build of gcc-4.6.2.

auto, lambda, stl, boost ... on a mc :)
